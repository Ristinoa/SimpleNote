# SimpleNote - a free, open source planner app

## What is SimpleNote?

Hi! My name's A.J., and I am oftentimes frustrated by the state of built-in planner apps. Why must there be so many unnecessary bells and whistles attached to a to-do list (looking at you, reminders app)? It is my firm belief that writing down a goal makes you infinitely more
likely to meet that goal! So, the idea of SimpleNote came to me; a free, open-source, and super basic to-do list to replace the massive
collection of TODO notes cluttering my phone's memory.

## Why did I make this?

A number of reasons, actually. The first is that my non-tech-savvy Grandfather needed a TODO list that had minimal distractions, was very
strightforward, and incredibly easy to use (e.g., accessible and user-friendly). I also wanted to try my hand at building an sqlite app. I'm
absolutely reinventing the wheel with this one, and that's perfectly fine by me. Every programmer makes one of these, it's my turn to follow suit.

## UPDATE LOG:

### 10/30/2024 - First version built

The base implementation of this project is a databse-driven webapp using SQLite. Essentially, it's a persistent database interface tool with three
different types of functionality: adding, removing, and displaying different "to do" items. The UI is pretty bare-bones, but that's because I built the entire thing during an hour break at work.
