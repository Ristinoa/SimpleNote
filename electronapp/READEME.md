# SimpleNote - a free, open source planner app â€” electron ver.

### Created by: [A.J. Ristino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-j-ristino-50760a228/)

## How do I launch the test version if I've cloned the repo?

Navigate to this folder (SimpleNote/electronapp) in your terminal and enter:

> npm install electron --save-dev

The scripts to run the base app are already in place. This install will add all needed files to node_modules.

To run the script use:

> npm run electron-start

This will launch an electron window with the app in it complete with DB functionality.
